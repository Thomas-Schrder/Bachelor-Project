## Introduction to Google Colab
Google Colab is a free cloud service based on Jupyter Notebooks that supports free GPU and a pre-configured environment. It's widely used for machine learning, data analysis, and education. Key features include:

## Ease of use: Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks hosted by Google. They require no setup and run entirely in the cloud.
Free Access to GPUs: Colab provides free access to GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) which are essential for training machine learning models.
Collaboration: Similar to Google Docs, Colab allows real-time collaboration with colleagues.
Integration with Google Drive: It offers seamless integration with Google Drive for saving work and accessing datasets.
